# DecisionTreeRegression
 a non-parametric model used for predicting continuous outcomes. Decision Tree Regression works by recursively splitting the dataset into smaller subsets based on the feature that provides the maximum information gain, leading to a tree structure where each leaf node represents a predicted value.
